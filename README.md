# team-profile-generator

## Description
For managers, it can be burdensome to keep track of employees and their relevant contact information. Instead of downloading complicated software to track something so simple, this project presents an easy-to-use application that allows users to enter in relevant employee details from the command-line. The application creates an HTML template that displays the team information in an organized way. 

## Usage
Upon starting the application, the user will prompted to answer a series of questions about the employees in the command line. Depending on the type of employee the user is entering information about, relevant information that applies to the position will be displayed on the employee's card. If the employee is an intern it will display the intern's school information, and others will have a link to their GitHub. 

## Installation
